.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use cross references to link to other sections within the MongoDB documentation.
You can reference to a specific page, or to a specified reference target on a
page.

Reference Targets
-----------------

To create a reference target on a page, use the following syntax above the section you
are referencing:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _reference-target-name:


The reference target can have any name, but the target must begin with
``.. _`` and end with a colon ``:``. Use **kebab-case**, all lowercase words
separated by dashes, for all reference names.

.. _link-to-reference:

To create a link to that specific reference target, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: rst'

    :ref:`Title To Display <reference-target-name>`


This example renders as: :ref:`Name to display <link-to-reference>`.

You can omit the display title and the carrot brackets if the reference target 
is directly above a heading. This causes Snooty to use the heading name as the 
link title. 

.. code-block:: none

    .. _sample-header-reference:

    =============
    Sample Header
    =============

    ...

    To learn more, see: :ref:`sample-header-reference`.

.. _sample-header-reference:

This renders as: To learn more, see: :ref:`Sample Header <sample-header-reference>`.

Commonly Used Roles
-------------------

You can reference other pages in the documentation using roles besides
```:ref:``. Some commonly used roles are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Role
     - Links To

   * - ``:doc:``
     - Another location within the MongoDB documentation

   * - ``:manual:``
     - A page in the latest stable version of the :manual:`MongoDB manual </>`
   
   * - ``:term:``
     - A term in the :manual:`glossary </reference/glossary>`

To see a full list of custom roles, see the
`Snooty parser rstspec.toml <https://github.com/mongodb/snooty-parser/blob/master/snooty/rstspec.toml>`__
   
Use these roles with the same syntax as linking to a reference,
:ref:`shown above <link-to-reference>`, replacing ``:ref:`` with the role you want
to use.

.. tip::

   If the role you are using links to a specific page, such as ``:manual:``, 
   you can further link to it's sub-pages by specifying the path in the brackets.
   For example, to link to the Bulk Write Operations page in the MongoDB manual, 
   use the following syntax.

   .. code-block:: language
   
      :manual:`Bulk Write Operations </core/bulk-write-operations>`

   This renders to :manual:`Bulk Write Operations </core/bulk-write-operations>`.
